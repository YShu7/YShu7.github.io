[55. Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)
#### Solution 
1. Always check if we can arrive at the next position,i.e. `curr >= idx`.  
1. Keep the furthest position we can approach.  
1. If we can always approach the next position and the furthest approachable is further than the last position, then can jump.  
```python
def canJump(self, nums):
    """
    :type nums: List[int]
    :rtype: bool
    """
    curr = 0
    for idx, num in enumerate(nums):
        if curr < idx:
            return False
        reachable = num + idx
        curr = max(curr, reachable)
    return len(nums) - 1 <= curr
```
