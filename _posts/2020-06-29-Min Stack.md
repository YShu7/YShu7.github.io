[155. Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)
#### Solution
1. When an element is pushed, it doesn't have to update the `min` value.

1. Only when the new min is pushed/popped, `min` get updated. 

1. We can bind `min` with the value, such that when an element is pushed/popped, we can know if it affects the `min`.

1. Store the information in a list of tuple `(x, min)`. Thus the last element always contains the `min`.

```python
def push(self, x):
    """
    :type x: int
    :rtype: None
    """
    if not self.stack:
        self.stack.append((x, x))
    else:
        self.stack.append((x, min(self.stack[-1][1], x)))
```
