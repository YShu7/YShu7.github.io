### Textures

Image Edges ≠ Perceived Boundaries

Perceived Boundaries rely on **texture**

#### Objects vs Texture

The same thing can be an object or a texture, depending on the scale of consideration

#### Why Analyze Texture?

For visual perception:

- Indicative of material properties
- Important appearance cue, especially if shape is similar across objects
- Aim to distinguish between shape, boundaries, and texture 

For computer vision: 

- Representation-wise, we want a feature one step above basic building block of simple filters, edges. 

#### Texture Representation

##### Example

Use 2 filters to compute x- and y-derivatives as a 2-dimensional feature

Draw (dx, dy) in the graph, the clusters represent different textures.

##### Window Scale

Possible to perform scale selection by looking for window scale where texture description not changing.

##### Filter Banks

Use multiple(*d*) filters to generate *d*-dimensional feature

$D(a,b)=\sqrt{(a_1-b_1)^2+(a_2-b_2)^2}$

A combination of scales and orientations, different types of patterns.

Filter banks can measure **redundant variety of structures** in **local**
**neighborhood** and result in multi-dimensional feature spaces

#### Textures are Repeated Local Patterns

##### Find the patterns

- Use filters that look like patterns (spots, bars, raw patches...)
- Consider magnitude of response 

##### Describe their statistics within each local window

- Mean, standard deviation
- Histogram
- Histogram of “prototypical” feature occurrences 

### Textons

An attempt to characterize texture

Replace each pixel with integer representing the texture 'type'

#### Computing Textons

Take a bank of filters and apply to lots of images

For new pixel, filter surrounding region with same bank, and assign to nearest cluster; pixel now represented with the cluster id. The cluster id is the texton id.

#### Histogram of Textons 

- Each material is now represented as a spatial arrangement of symbols from the texton vocabulary 
- Texture is defined by first order statistics of texton distribution, i.e., average density 
- For a given region, compute a *histogram* of textons as the representation: vector storing number of occurrences of each texton 

The smaller the difference between two histograms, the more similar they are.

**Texture representations** via filter bank response “summarize”
repeating patterns of local structure

#### Using Textons to Identify Boundaries

##### Segmentation with texture features

Find 'textons' by clustering vectors of filter bank outputs

Describe texture in a window based on texton histogram

#### What are Textures Good For?

- **Shape-from-texture**
- **Classification**
- **Retrieval** 
- **Segmentation**
  - Analyze, represent texture
  - Group image regions with consistent texture
- **Synthesis**
  - Generate new texture patches/images given some examples 

We can estimate surface’s 3D shape from deformation of texture from
point to point
