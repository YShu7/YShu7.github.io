[78. Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)
#### Solution  
1. For each subsets up to `i-1`, append `nums[i]` to the end of it to find subsets up to `i`. 
```python
def subsets(self, nums):
    """
    :type nums: List[int]
    :rtype: List[List[int]]
    """
    result = [[]]
    for num in nums:
        result += [i + [num] for i in result]
    return result
```
